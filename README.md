## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

The design (UI) wasn't that tough to put in code but I enjoyed the API integration aspect of this challenge.
I used IPify Geolocation API (https://geo.ipify.org) to get the IP Address location data as well as Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com) to generate the map.
